export const description =`This is where we will have the utils for the module. 
It will only contain utilties on the module level. In this case only utils that are only related to the buisness logic of the module.
General utilities should be under the capabilities/utils folder. 
For example. A ModuleProcessor class would be under the module utils folder, but a shared parseDate utility would be under the capabilities/utils folder.`
